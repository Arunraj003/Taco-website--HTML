              Talk to anyone in their 20s or early 30s about their first memory
              of a burger, and they‚Äôll all mention McDonald‚Äôs. Talk to someone a
              little above 35, and they‚Äùll know the real gems of homegrown
              burger brands ‚Äî the ones that had the sticky, sweet mayo, heavy
              meat, and soft buns. ‚ÄúMcDonald‚Äôs was definitely our generation‚Äôs
              introduction to the burger. The Chicken McGrill was economical and
              it was definitely a memorable introduction,‚Äù recalls Karan
              Dhillon, a marketing professional for whom food-blogging is a
              passion.
